SzybkiAAC is lightweight and fast an automatic account creator designed for TheForgottenServer.

There's no OOP. Why? It's just not needed, an AAC is really small and not complicated application which should be fast and secure.
Frameworks are good and useful but not in this kind of projects, you don't need those all mechanism provided by frameworks.

What more almost everybody can add features/new pages without knowledge about a framework beacuse it's really easy!
